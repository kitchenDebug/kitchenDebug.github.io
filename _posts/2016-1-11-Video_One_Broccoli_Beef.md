title: First Video! Crockpot Broccoli and Beef
---

I did it! I actually did it! I tackled editing (sort of) and uploaded my first video. I can promise that like a fine wine, they will only get better with age.

I'll slow start to populate my [Recipes](/recipes) page as I cook and film. Stay tuned for updates as I'm going to try to make 1-2 videos a week as I cook in my regular daily life. 

For now, check out video one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRayXBaTPrk
