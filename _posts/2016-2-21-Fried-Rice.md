I've made fried rice a few times now, taking what I've seen my dad turn into stir fry (pretty much anything and everything leftover in the fridge) but adding rice. Recently I've made fried rice with leftover turkey, random raw veggies, and then whatever frozen veggies I've had partial bags of. Plus a jalapeno! It's worked out really really well each time. 

JJ got me an enormous wok for my birthday. Or maybe it's a regular sized wok? It looks huge. We decided to test it out with fried rice, but we didn't really have leftovers this time. Like leftovers to add to the rice, we definitely had leftovers of the rice!

We used about 2 cups of pre-cooked rice, 2 eggs, chicken, leftover flank steak, and an assortment of frozen veggies (peas, corn, carrots, beans, edamame in a mixed bag). We also found one random jalapeno in the bottom of the fridge, still firm! Toss everything in gradually with oil and soy sauce and you have a delicious and fairly easy meal. Maybe next time I'll try to eyeball some measurements and turn it into a recipe!

Here's some pictures! Should I make a recipe? Should I do a video? Let me know!
