The easiest cutiest simpliest breakfast Pinterest will tell you you can make is Overnight Oats. It photographs like nobody's business in cute little Mason Jars and the flavor opportunities are literally endless. 

If you like oatmeal or the consistency of oatmeal you will probably like overnight oats. If you don't, you can go ahead and skip this post.

I eat my overnight oats cold out of a 1/2 pint Mason Jar. Typically I add chocolate chips (milk or dark) the morning of, but I'm not sure why I don't do it all at once the day before... Thinking about my thoughts here...
