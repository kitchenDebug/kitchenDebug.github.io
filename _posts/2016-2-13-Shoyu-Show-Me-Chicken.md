title: Shoyu Show Me Chicken
---

Did you miss me? I missed me. 

Couple of things, I'm now truly back into the swing of it. Between birthdays and vacation and some other unavoidable life things, I'm back in the kitchen. 

And I'm obsessed with making Hawaii food.

I'm pretty sure we were off the plane for all of 15 hours when I was like "I'm making Shoyu Chicken". It's easy, it's in the crockpot, and it makes a ton of food that heats up really well. So post vacation it's really the best kind of meal. 

Inspiration: http://www.heatherlikesfood.com/hawaiian-shoyu-chicken/

I had to tweak it. The first time we made it, the ginger was a little too chunky. Sure I probably could have cut it smaller, but then I remembered how much I threw away (sad) and how much I actually used (very little) and opted to try it with ground ginger this time. 

##Shoyu Chicken

Ingredients:

* 2ish pounds chicken breasts (we prefer white meat and minimal fat trimming)
* 1.5 cups soy sauce
* 1.5 cups water
* 1.5 cups sugar
* 1.5 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1/4 tsp ground ginger
* 1/2 tsp minced garlic

Steps:

1. Place chicken in crockpot. Add everything on top. 
2. Cook on LOW for 8 hours or HIGH for 4.
3. Shred chicken with forks before serving.

It's amazingly easy and extra delicious. We didn't use the sauce because we felt like the chicken was sitting in plenty of sauce already. In fact JJ, the boyfriend, usually eats Shoyu Chicken from the restaurant down the street with TONS of teriyaki (but maybe that's because he just loves teriyaki). But the stuff we make at home almost always leads to a heaping plate and a very full but happy JJ, with no extra sauce needed.
