title: Kolache Trial
---

Making breakfast, just like making anything else, requires time and patience. I already have no patience and in the morning I'd much rather lay in bed and pretend I'm still sleeping. So it's very ambitious of me to think about making anything that requires a substantial amount of effort (because of that time issue). Yet somehow I convinced myself that I would attempt to make kolaches.

Now for those of you who don't happen to know what a kolache is, they come in a couple different forms but mainly you either have fruit in the middle or meat inside. Personally I enjoy the meat variety, particularly jalapeno sausage and cheese. 

This is where they adventure starts. I knew I wasn't going to get up early enough to make and rise dough. So I found a recipe that even suggested making the dough the night before. Perfect.

Here is what we are working with: <http://baconbuttercheesegarlic.blogspot.com/2014/03/sausage-jalapeno-kolaches.html>

Of course I didn't follow it exactly because I have never seen or heard a person eat their kolache with mustard. Also kolaches need a yellow cheese, be that American or Cheddar.

Ingredients
* 1 package yeast (not instance or rapid rise)
* 1 1/4 cup milk
* 1/2 cup butter
* 2 eggs
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 cups flour
* 1 package Lil Smokies
* 2 fresh chopped jalapenos
* 1 package sliced sharp cheddar cheese
* 1 egg (for egg wash)

1. Put your yeast and sugar in the bowl of your mixer. Attach your bread hook.
2. Melt butter and milk on the stove with medium-low heat. (It shouldn't be bubbling, but it shouldn't take all night)
3. Remove butter and milk from heat, let cool about 5 minutes. Whisk in two eggs.
4. Add milk mixture to mixer bowl. Add flour and sugar. Turn mixer on low. Stand back to avoid flour clouds.
5. Increase speed until you have a dough ball and the sides of the bowl are clean. 
6. Transfer to greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap. Let rise on counter 1 hour. Refridgerate overnight (may require 1 punch down).

Here's where you keep reading, because this will make the difference between breakfast/brunch/lunch.

7. Remove dough from fridge. Allow dough to warm until dough is not cold to the touch.
8. Roll out to even thickness (1/2 inch or smaller). Cut into equal parts.
9. Place cheese, sausage (2ish Lil Smokies), and jalapenos on dough and pull sides together. Create seam along the bottom. 
10. Brush egg wash (add a little water to thin egg) on each kolache.
11. Bake at 350 for about 20-25 minutes or until slightly browned.

If you read the recipe that was my inspiration, you'll notice there is an extra 30-45 minute rise. I decided that was optional, and let me tell you they turned out just fine. 

Maybe this has a video in its future. But trial 1 only has pictures for now.
