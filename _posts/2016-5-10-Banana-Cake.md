title: Banana Cake (Gluten Free Even!)
---

I'll admit it - I have like 10 sad looking extra frozen bananas in my freezer pretty much at all times. Many of them started their lives at Intel (well I guess they didn't really start there as they didn't grow there...) and then ended up sitting on my desk uneaten. They would eventually make it into my house, sit on the counter, and turn brown. They would then join their frozen brothers and sisters in my freezer. Intel allows employees one piece of free fruit a day, and I hoard them in my freezer like the apocalypse can be staved via frozen fruits.

Because my banana hoarding seems to frequently get out of hand I’m always on the lookout for recipes that take my 10 bananas and do something delicious with them. That’s what brings me to this post. 

Banana breads take about 2-3 bananas, size and batter consistency depending. Most of these recipes seem to indicate grocery stores (and Intel) offer bananas of varying size. The only bananas I seem to find range in size super huge to enormously huge, so 2-3 bananas in a recipe is more like 2. I simply don’t have time to make banana bread at the rate of 2 bananas a bread. My freezer would literally just be bananas at that rate. Literal b-a-n-a-n-a-s.

Banana cake on the other hand always takes like 3-4 bananas (sometimes more!) which easily doubles my banana ratio. 4 bananas per cake is more of my speed! So that settles it, we are making banana cake.

As you may or may not know Intel is going through a layoff and restructuring period. This shouldn’t be news to anyone. I read somewhere that sharing baked goods is as much a morale booster as it is a waistline booster. We have a gluten free teammate and because I’ve decided he should have the potential to gain baked good induced weight right along with us, I used the rest of my Bob’s Red Mill 1 to 1 Baking Mix and made the banana cake gluten free. AND IT WAS AMAZING.

Make it gluten free with Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 Baking Mix.

It was moist and delicious and so flavorful. The consistency was perfect! And it was so great I took it to work and got zero pictures because we were all busy stuffing our faces with banana cake. Instant morale booster and -4 bananas in my fridge.

Except I just brought home another one. And now I'm hoarding apples at my desk. Someone help me.
