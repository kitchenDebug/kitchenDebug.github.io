title: Pumpkin Spice Extract?
---

Sometimes I amaze myself. Like seriously, what the hell is Pumpkin Spice extract? I was really convinced that the Pumpkin Pie Spice was actually Pumpkin Spice extract. So much so I didn't even bother to correct myself. It's the litte things that keep you entertained while editing.

Anyway! Another video, actually made the same day as the [Broccoli and Beef](http://kitchendebug.com/Video_One_Broccoli_Beef/)! As I mention in the video I tend to do the bulk of my weekly cooking on Sunday. I have a bunch of time then and I'd like to make it through the week without starving. I don't like starving.

I typically make my own breakfast. Occasionally I'll take dry cereal or a granola bar, but recently I've been taking overnight oats or muffins. Or oaty muffins. 11 deliciously pumpkiny oaty muffins.
