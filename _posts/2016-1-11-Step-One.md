title: Step One... Step Two...
---

##Step 1
Build out your online presence. Spend an entire Saturday afternoon fighting the Internet lords, attempt to demistify YouTube, and force Premiere Pro to do your bidding. Ok maybe that wasn't really one step so much as that was like multiple little one steps.

##Step 2
Spend an entire Sunday cooking while holding a tiny camera you are absolutely convinced you are going to drop. Remember that you hate being in front of a camera 1000x more than a live audience of any size. Premiere Pro better work magic, that's all I'm saying.

So if you are following along, you may notice I'm tweeting (@kitchenDebug) but I'm still largely silent on YouTube. Yes, editting is an evil mistress. When I get editting out of the way, I've got some content that will go up. I'm targeting for about 1-2 videos a week (as that's about how often I cook) but editting might slow that down... uh... significantly. Let's just say it's much easier to write code and program apps than it is to edit. For now at least :)

Once everything gets rolling along, I anticipate that most of the posts will be 100% recipes and tips and 0% rambling. Because the rambling will be baked in. 

GET IT? 

BAKED? 

I'm done.
