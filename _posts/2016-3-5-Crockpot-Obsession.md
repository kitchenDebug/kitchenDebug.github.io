title: Crockpot Obsession

I have an obsession with crockpot recipes. And how could I not? They are so darn simple. 

You may have seen I got another video up late last night. I'm pretty proud of myself for getting that filmed and editted so quickly. Bonus points for me!

Also, I may have content on YouTube without having a blog post here. It's just how I roll sometimes.

Also, also, I'm doing some serious cooking tomorrow. I'd anticipate a blog and a video (at least!) about it later this week.
