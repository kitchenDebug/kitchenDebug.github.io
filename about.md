###What Am I Doing Here?
Or maybe I should ask what are YOU doing here?

##TL;DR
“Vlog style” cooking channel with little flare and minimal fancy gadgets. Ain’t nobody got time for that 6 hour prep and 4 hour cook on a Tuesday night. Cooking is easy when you follow the directions. Use what you have to make great fresh food.

##The Longer Story
It started as somewhat of a joke. Host a YouTube show, maybe DIY home improvements. But really you can do anything with the help of the Internet. 

A cashier told my boyfriend and I that she was surprised to see two young people buying ingredients to actually cook something, and not just heat frozen items. That's absurd. More and more I run into people (young and old) who don't know the cooking basics or who are too afraid to even begin. I want to inspire others and help them gain the confidence to cook, experiment more, or measure less.

Come with me on this journey. I'll show you how I cook, shop, and setup my kitchen. We'll talk about ways to make finding recipes less of a chore and ways to execute with little to no errors.

### Who Am I?

My name is Amara. I'm a part time kitchen finatic and a full time software developer. After years of consuming the internet, I decided it was time to challenge myself to contributing back. I've set myself up to keep most of the software junk separate, but after all this is kitchenDebug. As in debugging your recipes (like code) not removing unwanted pests.
